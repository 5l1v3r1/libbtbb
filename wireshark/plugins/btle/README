BTLE Wireshark plugin
=====================

This is the Bluetooth Low Energy plugin for Wireshark.

To build this on Debian/Ubuntu/BackTrack linux distributions:
  sudo apt-get install wireshark-dev wireshark
  cd libbtbb/wireshark/plugins/btle/
  cmake .
  make
  make install

This will install to the .wireshark/ in your home directory. To override
this set the DESTDIR environment variable when running cmake.

PPI Support (Patch)
-------------------

Ubertooth records capture frequency, internal clock state, and certain
other metadata about packets in a PPI header. It is not possible to add
PPI support in an external plugin, so if you wish to access these fields
you must patch Wireshark.

The patch wireshark-1.8-btle-ppi.patch was built against the Ubuntu
12.10 Quantal Wireshark package. It can be added to the Ubuntu package
source or applied directly to vanilla Wireshark.

To build a .deb on Ubuntu, follow these instructions:

	mkdir wireshark && cd wireshark
	apt-get source wireshark
	cp wireshark-1.8-btle-ppi.patch wireshark-1.8.2/debian/patches
	echo wireshark-1.8-btle-ppi.patch >> wireshark-1.8.2/debian/patches/series
	cd wireshark-1.8.2
	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

The .deb will be created in the wireshark directory, and it can be
installed with dpkg -i.
