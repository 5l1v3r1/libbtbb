This directory contains supplemental tools for working with pcap files produced
by gr-bluetooth.  (Actually gr-bluetooth doesn't produce such files by itself
at this time, but you can produce them with tcpdump listening on a tun
interface that is written to by btrx -w).

These tools are not automatically installed as part of the gr-bluetooth
installation but can be used right out of this directory or manually installed.


btaptap: a Bluetooth keyboard sniffer

Many Bluetooth keyboards operate by default in "boot mode" which features
simplified HID messaging that can be interpreted, for example, by a PC BIOS.
Some of those keyboards also transmit these messages over unencrypted
Bluetooth.  This tool can be used to extract keystrokes from such
transmissions.
